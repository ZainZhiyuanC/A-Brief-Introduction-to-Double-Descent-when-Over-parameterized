# A-Brief-Introduction-to-Double-Descent-when-Over-parameterized
Introduce the work of Belkin et al.(2019, 2020) and Nakkiran et al.(2019) on the double descent phenomenon: In machine learning models, when the dimension of parameter space grows beyond population (called high-dimension in statistics), the fitted generalization error follows a U-shaped curve first and then drops again.
